Try these exercises
-------------------
Exercise 1:
Have a look at the pdf file that was created.

Exercise 2:
Change the number of MC events that you loop over.  
This is done in analyses/example.py (e.g., change 100 to -1).
Re-run.

Exercise 3:
Look at where the data files are specified.
This is done in samples.py, e.g. in the function "add_example_skimmed_900_GeV_Data".

Exercise 4:
Add an existing step to the list of steps you're using.
E.g., in lists.py, uncomment "extraVariableGreaterFilter(25.0,jetCollection+"Ht"+jetSuffix)," in the list "steps" in the function "addListJetKineLook".
Re-run.

Exercise 5:
Add a new step.
E.g., in stepsOther.py, uncomment bxHistogrammer and add it to your list of steps in lists.py.
Re-run.  Look for the new plot in the pdf file.

Exercise 6:
Make skims (in this case, one for data, one for MC).  E.g., in lists.py, uncomment "skimmer("/tmp/")," and re-run.  Check the skimmed files that are written out.

Exercise 7:
Read the file "readme.txt".
