----------
* email spec for handling colliding CRAB results
* spec for weighting sim appropriately by cross-section, to default lumi, or to lumi specified by data
* two schemes for handling overlapping cross sections (pythia qcd)

Other
--------
* jets factors and rewriting jets
* cut flow study infrastructure
* in/dependence tools
* in/dependence shotgun
* consider uncertainty on zero

* config parameter interface
* config sample interface, effective lumi argument, test mode
* multi-site samples handles
* protect against samples collisions

* handle float-based vectors
* migrate to new ROOT
* un black-list leaf when using new root

* consider threshold for adding muons to jets
* is outputDir necessary in .slice()?
* in analysis.py: looper.setupSteps(minimal = True) #determine why this is needed
* run on lxplus
* capitalize master
* clean up inputFileList
* store inputFileList in root file?

* analysis restructure
* consider arguments to analysisLooper
* generic batch mode

(ongoing)
* profile

(ntupler)
* light/lite ntuple mode
* stage-out
* prune gen MET
* check extra spike vars

(low priority)
* move ratio marker
* 2D ratios
* logfiles
* organize files in cvs
* named arguments everywhere
* update example ntuples
* non-linear cutflow
* fix extra tree functionality in skimmer
* handle subdirectories of input file directories
