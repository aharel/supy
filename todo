other mc samples
all data in the bag

Critical
---------
* recipe for anyone to reproduce results in 5 minutes
* way to avoid hardcoding output directories to particular user
* report configuration of calculables
* move default calculables to analysis
* easier replacement of calculables (configure calculables via config file rather than hardcoded)
* warn about partial run over data
* lumi/run list of actually processed jobs (jsonMaker)
* make name of tree and directory configurable
* cross section in database
* mem leaks

Document
----------
* email spec for handling colliding CRAB results
* spec for weighting sim appropriately by cross-section, to default lumi, or to lumi specified by data
* two schemes for handling overlapping cross sections (pythia qcd)

Other
--------
* organize files in cvs
* skimmer 2,3 should raise exceptions
* defer srmls until jobs runs

* named arguments everywhere

* display rechits
* fix circle

* clean up output files

* option to skip computation of nEvents in TChain

* keep lumiTree unskimmed
* jsonMaker
* Investigate skimmers
* skimmer prefix and suffix
* phase out extraVars

* reincarnate plotter
* tdrPlotter
* merging histos for different samples (eg, add all mc)
* list the selection on the plot

* better sample organization

* Book

* non-linear cutflow / directory structured output
* histo sculpting

* profile

* batch queue

* logfiles
